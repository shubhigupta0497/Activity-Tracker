# Android application (Activity Tracker) to collect User Data

Smartphones are an indispensable part of our everyday lives, providing the functionality of media players, digital cameras, web browsers, gaming, navigation and high-speed internet access, all on a single touch. Previous studies have exhibited that misuse of this privilege have a negative impact on people as they tend to neglect their personal well-being and fail to care for their surroundings. Excessive engagement in smartphones leads to poor academic performance, irregular sleeping patterns, decreased satisfaction in life, anxiety, stress and overall mental well-being. 

In this study, we developed an Android application (Activity Tracker) to record the various events of each user pertaining to smartphone usage -
1. Number of calls
2. Duration of Calls
2. Number of text messages sent and received each day
3. Daily usage of various types of applications, which were later clubbed into buckets 
    - Social
    - Entertainment
    - Utility
    - Gaming
    - Shopping
    - Food
    - Drinks
4. Age
5. Gender
6. Screen-on Duration of the smartphone
7. Smartphone Addiction Questionnaire Score - The resultant score that was computed through Smartphone Addiction Scale – Short Version (SAS – SV)
8. Esteem Score - The self-esteem of a participant on a likert scale of 1-7
    
Data collected was then used as features to train supervised learning classification models to compute their correlation to smartphone addiction.
We were able to predict whether the participants suffered from smartphone addiction or not with an accuracy of 73.3%.
